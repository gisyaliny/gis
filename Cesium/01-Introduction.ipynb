    "Cesium is an **open-source JavaScript library** for creating 3D globes and maps. It allows developers to build interactive web-based applications with high-performance rendering of geospatial data. Cesium is particularly renowned for its capability to visualize **large-scale**, **time-dynamic**, and **geographically**\n",

    "## Support Data Format\n",
    "\n",
    "- `GeoJSON`: A lightweight format for encoding geospatial data using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `KML (Keyhole Markup Language)`: An XML-based format for expressing geographic annotation and visualization within Internet-based maps and Earth browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `CZML (Cesium Language)`: A JSON-based format specifically designed for Cesium, allowing developers to describe time-dynamic scenes in Cesium applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `3D Tiles`: A format for streaming massive heterogeneous 3D geospatial datasets, enabling efficient visualization of large-scale 3D content such as terrain, buildings, and point clouds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Tileset`: Cesium supports various tileset formats for efficiently rendering large-scale datasets, including formats like quantized-mesh, 3D Tiles, and terrain tiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `STL (Stereolithography)`: A file format native to the stereolithography `CAD` software used for creating 3D models, commonly used for representing 3D geometry in Cesium applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `COLLADA (COLLAborative Design Activity)`: A 3D model interchange format for exchanging digital assets between different graphics software applications, often used for importing 3D models into Cesium scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `OBJ (Wavefront .obj file)`: A simple text-based format for representing 3D models, suitable for importing into Cesium applications for visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `GML (Geography Markup Language)`: An `XML`-based encoding for the transport and storage of geographic information, supported in Cesium for interoperability with GIS systems.\n"
