    "\n",

    "2. For **very big or very small numbers**, you may also use scientific notation by adding an `e` (for exponent), followed by the exponent of the number. `2.998e8`\n",
    "3. **Special numbers**: There are three special values in JavaScript that are considered `numbers` but don’t behave like normal `numbers`.\n",
    "   1. The first two are `Infinity` and `-Infinity`\n",
    "   2. Third is `NaN`, stands for “not a number”\n",
    "\n",
    "- JavaScript uses a fixed number of bits, **64 of them**, to store a single `number` value.\n",
    "- The important thing is to be aware of it and **treat fractional digital numbers as approximations**, not as precise values.\n"

    "2. Subtraction (`-`): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.\n",

    "   1. `\"con\" + \"cat\" + \"e\" + \"nate\"`\n",

    "   let a = true;\n",
    "   let b = false;\n",
    "   console.log(a || b); // Outputs: true\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. `Logical NOT (!)`: This operator returns the opposite boolean value of the operand. If the operand is true, it returns false, and if the operand is false, it returns true.\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "   let p = true;\n",
